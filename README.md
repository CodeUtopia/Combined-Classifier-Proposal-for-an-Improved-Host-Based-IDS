# Combined-Classifier-Proposal-for-an-Improved-Host-Based-IDS
This Research Paper is a proposal for a new IDS (Intrusion Detection System) which can offer higher detection rates for intrusions of the OS Kernel. Because IDS is traditionally placed on the application layer of a host, Any malware or intrusions that pass this IDS can reach the OS kernel; any changes in the OS kernel then becomes hard to detect due to being considered part of the kernel. To help prevent this, a host-based IDS  should be added on top of the OS kernel to specifically detect these intrusions and malware. This paper is a proposal on how to create such a host-based IDS.
